Dotfiles

> My personal configurations, which help me do may day-to-day work.

Install
=======

1) *Recommended*: Clone the repository locally, preferably to `~/.dotfiles`.
	- `git clone https://github.com/yarthur/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
	- If you do not clone the repository, download install.sh. It will then clone to ~/.dotfiles for you.
2) Execute `./install.sh`.
	- If you clone the repo to a location other than ~/.dotfiles, a symlink will be created there.
3) That shold be it.
4) Currently, the macOS changes (`./lib/macOS.sh`) are not installed by default. Run those manually if desired.
